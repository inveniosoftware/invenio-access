    """Represents a set of required needs.

    Extends Flask-Principal's :py:class:`flask_principal.Permission` with
    support for loading action grants from the database including caching
    support.

    Essentially the class works as a translation layer that expands action
    needs into a list of user/roles needs. For instance, take the following
    permission:

    .. code-block:: python

        Permission(ActionNeed('my-action'))

    Once the permission is checked with an identity, the class will fetch a
    list of all users and roles that have been granted/denied access to the
    action, and expand the permission into something similar to (depending
    on the state of the database):

    .. code-block:: python

        Permission(UserNeed('1'), RoleNeed('admin'))

    The expansion is cached until the action is modified (e.g. a user is
    granted access to the action). The alternative approach to expanding the
    action need like this class is doing, would be to load the list of allowed
    actions for a user on login and cache the result. However retrieving all
    allowed actions for a  user could results in very large lists, where as
    caching allowed users/roles for an action would usually yield smaller lists
    (especially if roles are used).
